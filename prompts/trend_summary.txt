Based on today's {n} signals and the past {weeks} weeks of trend data, identify the cross-source pattern — something that multiple signals point to but nobody has explicitly articulated yet.

Write a 3-4 sentence paragraph in Chinese (technical terms in English). Be specific and insightful, not generic.

Today's top signals:
{signals_summary}

Trend trajectories:
{trends_summary}

Output the paragraph directly as plain text (not JSON).

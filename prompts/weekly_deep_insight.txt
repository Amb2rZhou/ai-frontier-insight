Generate a deep analysis report. Write in Chinese with English technical terms. Be specific, analytical, and forward-looking — avoid generic observations.

Required sections:
1. **context**: Why this theme now? What triggered this analysis? (1 paragraph)
2. **why_this_matters**: Deep analysis of significance. Connect dots across signals. (2-3 paragraphs)
3. **what_changes**: Concrete, actionable implications with rough timeline. (numbered list, 3-5 items)
4. **what_comes_next**: Forward-looking predictions with confidence level (high/medium/low). (numbered list, 2-4 items)
5. **self_correction**: Review past predictions honestly. What was right? What was wrong? Why? (1 paragraph, skip if no predictions to review)
